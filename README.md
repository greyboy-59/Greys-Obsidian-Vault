# Welcome!

First of all, I would like to thank you for your support and for keeping on top of my work and progress.

It's been a few weeks since I last shared an update on the gaming hub I've been working on. 
The truth is, I was so excited about it so I created other dashboards to track some of my hobbies.

## Setup

1. Download the vault as a .zip file.
2. Extract the contents of the .zip file and save them to a folder of your choice.
3. Open Obsidian and select the 'Open folder as a vault' option.
4. Select the folder in which you saved all the extracted files.
5. When prompted, select 'Trust author and enable plugins' (the plugins used are listed below).
6. Enjoy!

## Use case

There are many ways in which you can use the Obsidian Vault. The default setup includes pinned dashboards and an additional window on the right-hand side of the vault, which opens all the pages linked to each dashboard.
You can unpin any page you like. The only thing I should mention is that if you use a custom theme, the columns feature may stop working. I used the default Obsidian theme because I like it, but be careful when installing a custom theme.

Every dashboard includes two buttons. The first button allows you to create a page containing information related to that dashboard. For example, if you are in the Gaming Hub dashboard, you can click on 'New game' and enter the desired title. 
This feature uses the Media DB plugin, which allows you to search for anything based on the APIs set in the plugin's settings. It is important to note this in case you want to use sources such as Giant Bomb or IMDb, so you can set them up if they are available.

The second button helps you create any page related to the content within the dashboard. Taking the Gaming Hub as an example again, this includes a button to create a Franchise page related to any video game. This also uses the Media DB plugin, so feel free to use it straight away.

### Additional features

Each dashboard contains content related to video games, books, music, among other things. It also includes bases to categorise the media you consume.

In the case of the Gaming Hub dashboard, for example, there is a base in gallery view under the name 'Library' that helps you to categorise each game by platform. 
This base summarises how many pages are backlinked to those shown in the base, splitting this information based on the status of those pages:

- Owned
- In_progress
- Completed
- Platinum

**Please note**. If you are not familiar with Obsidian or any of its plugins, I would strongly advise against removing the following properties from all Obsidian pages, regardless of their nature:

- Active
- Artist
- Author
- Category
- Completed
- Developer
- DNT
- Franchise
- In_progress
- Inactive
- Next
- Owned
- Platform
- Platinum
- Publisher
- Shared
- Studio
- Unsuscribed

If any of those properties are removed, some functions within each dashboard or base may stop working. However, this won't break the app or cause any problems with your device lol. Just minor details.
